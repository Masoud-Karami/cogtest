#LLMs Tasks For Memory Experiments

## Require identifying relevant info in their input contexts:
- multi-document question answering
    . mimics the retrieval-augmented generation setup
    . changing the position can affect model performance
    . U-shaped performance (accuracy-position) curve
- key-value retrieval
