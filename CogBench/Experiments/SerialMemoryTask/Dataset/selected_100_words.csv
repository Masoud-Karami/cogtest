happy
after
the
fight
that
I
ran
upstairs
in
their
house
and
wrote
Speechless
Fun
inspires
me
I
hate
to
say
that
because
it
's
such
a
romantic
song
But
it
was

fight
that
did
it
I
was
happy
and
I
wrote
it
in
it
's

entirety
right
there
I
felt
it
would
be
good
enough
for
the
album
Out
of
the
bliss
comes
magic
wonderment
and
creativity

a
reflection
on

's
own
personal

is
about
media
invasions
and
tabloid
inaccuracies
The
Lost
Children
is
about
imperiled
children
